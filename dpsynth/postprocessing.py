  This function uses Private-PGM to solve the L2 minimization problem:

  where y is the concatenated vector of noisy marginals, Q is the function
  that maps a probability distribution to its marginals, and p is optimized
  over the set of probability distributions within the class of undirected
  graphical models (markov random fields).

  Note on domain discovery: The categorical domain is automatically inferred
  from the noisy marginals by taking the union of obesrved attribute values
  across all noisy marginals.  If a specific attribute value is observed in one
  noisy marginal but not another, we assume it was unmeasured, rather than
  assuming it was measured with a zero count. This matches the behavior
  of federated analytics SQL pipelines, for instance.

  Args:
    noisy_marginals: A list of marginals, each of which is a dataframe, where
      the first k columns are the attribute values and the last column is the
      count.
    iters: The number of iterations to run the optimization for.
    log: Whether to log the progress of the optimization.
    nrows: The number of rows of synthetic data to generate. If None, the number
      of rows will be estimated from the marginals.
    estimator: The estimator to use for the optimization.
    marginal_oracle: The marginal oracle to use for the optimization.
    exact_marginals: A list of exact marginals in the same format as noisy
      marginals. If provided, the error between the estimated marginals and the
      exact marginals will be logged during optimization.
