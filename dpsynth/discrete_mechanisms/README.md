# Discrete Mechanisms for Synthetic Tabular Data

<!-- disableFinding(LINK_RELATIVE_G3DOC) -->

This directory contains implementations of several Differentially Private (DP)
mechanisms that operate over **discrete** synthetic tabular data. These
mechanisms follow the SELECT-MEASURE-GENERATE paradigm to produce synthetic data
that approximates the true distribution while satisfying differential privacy.

In addition to providing standalone mechanisms, this package serves as a
critical **utility provider** for the rest of the project.

## Core Roles & Module Interactions

### 1. Local Mechanism Execution

This directory provides the "brains" for local, in-memory data synthesis. The
primary entry point is `run_mechanism` (in [api.py](api.py)), which orchestrates
specific algorithms (AIM, MST, etc.) on single-machine datasets (typically
loaded via Pandas or NumPy).

### 2. Common Utility Provider

The [common.py](common.py) module provides essential logic used project-wide:

- **Domain Compression**: Implements the logic to calculate DP one-way
  marginals and merge rare values into an "Other" category. This is heavily
  relied upon by the `DatasetDescriptor.compress()` logic and distributed
  pipelines.
- **DP Primitives**: Implements the Exponential mechanism and Gaussian
  mechanism logic used by various components.

### 3. Integration with `mbi`

All mechanisms in this package are built on top of the `mbi` library:

- **Inputs**: Mechanisms consume `mbi.Projectable` objects (discrete data).
- **Outputs**: Mechanisms produce `mbi.MarkovRandomField` objects, which model
  the approximated distribution and are used to sample synthetic records.

### 4. Privacy Accounting

The [accounting.py](accounting.py) module handles the translation layer between human-readable privacy parameters and internal scale vectors required by the noise generation subsystems:

- **Approximate DP to zCDP:** Translates high-level user parameters $(\epsilon, \delta)$ into a total zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy budget ($\rho$) using `zcdp_rho`.

* **Budget Composition & Allocations:** Tracks privacy expenditure across iterative exacution rounds (e.g., inside [aim.py](aim.py)), converting a round's allocated budget (`rho_per_round`) directly into a standard deviation ($\sigma$) via `zcdp_gaussian_sigma` where $\rho = \frac{0.5}{\sigma^2}$.

* **Alternative Accounting Frameworks:** Provides direct calculation layers for Gaussian Differential Privacy ($\mu$-GDP via `aim_gdp.py` and `gdp_gaussian_sigma`) and parameter mapping bounds for the Exponential mechanism (`zcdp_exponential_eps`).

## Relationship to Other Packages

- **[dataset_descriptors/](../dataset_descriptors/)**: Provides the
  `DatasetDescriptor.encode()` method which produces the discrete
  integer-encoded data that these mechanisms require.
- **[pipeline_transformations/](../pipeline_transformations/)**: Contains
  distributed, production-scale implementations of these same algorithms
  (using Apache Beam). Many pipeline transformations reuse the mathematical
  utilities defined here.

## Mechanisms Implemented

- **Adaptive+Iterative Mechanism (AIM)** (`aim.py`, `aim_gdp.py`): An
  MWEM-style algorithm that iteratively improves the estimation of the data
  distribution.
- **Maximum Spanning Tree (MST)** (`mst.py`): Computes an approximate maximum
  spanning tree to model pairwise correlations privately.
- **Direct Mechanism** (`direct.py`): Measures user-prespecified two-way
  marginals and fits a distribution via mirror descent.
- **Independent Mechanism** (`independent.py`): A baseline approach that
  models all attributes as independent.

## Utilities and Privacy Accounting

- **`common.py`**: Shared logic for exponential mechanisms, measurement
  noising, and domain compression.
- **`accounting.py`**: Translation layer for DP budget accounting (zCDP, GDP,
  Approximate DP).
